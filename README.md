# SpringBoot + LangChain4j + Ollama

This is a starter project for working with Large Language Models to build applications. 
The LangChain4j framework is used to manage and orchestrate LLM communication, while SpringBoot 
is the foundation for the software itself. 

Demos on LangChain4j + Ollama can be found in the following repository, which also contains a workshop 
to build your own researcher, or group chat application.
